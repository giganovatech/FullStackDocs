This repo is intended to serve as a simple way for developers to share their knowledge as efficiently as possible. No long winded tutorials or explanations, trolling or flame wars. Just samples with short explanations. When adding to this repo please try to keep it to a comment of 140 characters or less and either a sample command or sample code. Please add new folders for new topics. New topics being things like python, centos or git. Add subfolders for more specific sections such as a section for arrays in the python folder. Happy sharing!
