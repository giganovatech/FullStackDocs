#Download and open PuTTYgen

#Generate a public/private key pair on your local desktop. Click the Generate button. You will be prompted to move the mouse over the blank area to generate some randomness. Do so. #Shortly thereafter, the program will generate the key and display the result

#Enter a passphrase in the "Key passphrase" and "Confirm passphrase" boxes. Your CCID password makes a good choice since you have probably already committed it to memory and it has #withstood password cracking tests. However, the PuTTY documentation recommends an actual phrase of 10 to 30 characters with word breaks, mixed case, numbers, and non-alphanumeric #characters, for example, "DoN't (expect snow)^july." Instead of trying to create a good passphrase on your own, seriously consider the recommendations posted on www.diceware.com.
#Under no circumstances should you leave these fields blank.
#Select all of the text in the box labeled "Public key for pasting into OpenSSH authorized_keys file" (near the top of the window) by dragging the cursor. Right-click over the #selection and choose Copy. Finally, click the "Save private key" button to save the private key to a file.
#The private key must be kept secret. Accordingly, the contents of the file are encrypted using the passphrase, and you should pick a file location that is accessible only to you.
#If you share your computer and you do not have a separate account (id) with private disk space, do not use public key authentication. If in doubt, do not use public key #authentication.
#You can recover the public key from the private key with PuTTYgen by clicking the Load button. You can not recover the private key from the public key however.
