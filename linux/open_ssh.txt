# Generate SSH keys. The private key which is generated, id_rsa, stays on the local server you want to login from. The public key, id_rsa.pub, gets copied into the authorized_keys file on remote servers to allow you to log in as that user.
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "comments_go_here"  # In comments sections it is preferred to put user@server

# Copy the public half of the key pair you created to your remote server using the following command. The contents of your ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub key into a file in the remote accountâ€™s home ~/.ssh directory called authorized_keys.
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user@server

# SSH with specific key file.
ssh -i aws-iits-pem.pem ec2-user@10.108.33.68
